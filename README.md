# Project I: AlmaCeax
AlmaCeax team is doing a tribute to the game "X-Multiply". It is an arcade video game Shoot 'em Up horizontal developed by Irem, a Japanese study of video games, in 1989. Taking clear elements of R-Type, X-Multiply is based on levels of "horror" or gore to recreate a setting of terror, as if we were facing horrendous monsters and rotten things that come out of the walls. With the help of the two tentacles that the ship has when you take the Power Up we will have to go through the seven levels of play and defeat each of the final bosses that each level has.

# How to play the game
Pilot a ship shooting enemies, dodging bullets and taking powerups until you reach the end of stage 1.
